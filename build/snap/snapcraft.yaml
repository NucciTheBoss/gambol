  A simple workflow engine for distributed applications ðŸŽ¬ ðŸŒŒ

  gambol enables you to write straightforward workflows that can
  be run on no-frills cloud environments. Rather than require you
  to be an expert in cloud infrastructure, gambol allows you focus
  on what matters: **getting work done**. You can write end-to-end
  tests for your distributed application, test packages in isolated
  environments, create comphrensive testing suites that can run both
  locally and in the cloud, and more. Say goodbye to spending half your
  day just setting up your testing infrastructure with shell script soup!
